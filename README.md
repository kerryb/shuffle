# Shuffle

A simple letter shuffler to save you having to find a pen and paper when doing
the crossword.

It’s pure static html, javascript and css, so will work offline, and can be
installed as a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app). You
can find it at [shuffle.kerryb.org](https://shuffle.kerryb.org), or just
download the `app` directory and open `index.html` to run it locally.
